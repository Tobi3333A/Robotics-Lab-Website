# XULA Robotics Lab
I was instructed to make a website for my school's robotics lab that will include what the lab is, what we do in the lab, and every robotics student in the school and their profiles. This project is here on GitHub as I am **currently working** on it, and I need a server to see how responsive it is.
## Features
- **General Information:** This website is to include general information of Xavier University of Louisiana's Robotics Lab: our mission, work, etc.
- **Projects:** The website is also to include the work we do in the lab: our research, our outreach, our inventions, etc.
- **Personalized Student Profiles:** The website is also to include the profiles for each robotics student of Xavier.
- **Research Labs:** Also, the website will include pictures and videos of the lab to show the visuals of the lab, so viewers can have an actual feel of it.
## Technologes Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
## Future Improvements
I will continue working on the website as I receive instructions from my professor on what he wants me to put on certain pages. I also need to get the information of the students and begin creating their profiles.
